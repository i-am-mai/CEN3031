**Project Name**: 

**Project Description**:
Our project will essentially create a website for a tutoring service. It will be a system to help tutors and students connect. The website will be accessible by both the tutor and student, which means once the user logs in they will see different screens. The student will be able to search for subjects and find tutors who they can contact. The tutor will be able to add their contact information and subjects they are comfortable with. There will also be a section where students can rate tutors they have interacted with. Overall, our project "Tutoring " will help students and tutors communicate easily and safely on this new platform.
