# Sprint 1

**Goals**:
- User stories:
    - As a student, I want to be able to find a tutor with relevant subject knowledge, so that I can do better in my studies. 
    - As a student, I want to know how capable each tutor is, so that I can choose the best tutor for me.
    - As a tutor, I want to be able to find students, so I can help other students do better in school. 
    - As a tutor, I want to know what my students think of my tutoring so that I can better suit their needs.

- Set of issues:
    - complete the login & create account screens
    - way to add and save an account
    - check to make sure account is unique
    - account manipulations (edit, delete, etc.)
    - update account database every time this happens
    
**Submit**:
- seperate front-end & back-end videos
  
**What went wrong**:
Backend Issues: When we first started working on the backend, we were not able to get the account manipulations to work. We also had trouble figuring out the curl requests until we started using Postman. When we changed the formatting of our code and learned how to properly use Postman, we were able to figure it out. 

Frontend Issues: We had problems getting the button to work. The button was meant to direct the user to another page, but the button wouldn't do anything besides stay at the same page and update the address bar by adding the name of the file after. The page itself wasn't updating. We found out the angular has its own way for routing buttons, so we will be fixing it in Sprint 2.
